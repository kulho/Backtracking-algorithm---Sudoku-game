# Backtracking algorithm - Sudoku game
My take on backtracking algorithm. Game of sudoku is used to visualize the backtracking algorithm

Click on a square to select it. Type a number to write it in the selected box as a suggetion. 
If you think it is correct press Enter and game will check for row, column and current square
and places it as the answer if it can.

When you get bored with it, you can just press spacebar for the backtracking algorithm to kick
in and solve the sudoku for you with a visualisation of the process ;)

You can modify the initial board in board.txt
